  # Hyperpass - Powered by [Holepunch](https://holepunch.to)🕳️🥊

📱 Hyperpass is an open-source P2P application that allows you to save your passwords in a completely secure and encrypted way. 🚀

## ✍️ Philosophy

Key principles that guided the creation of this application:

- **🔒 Security**: Your passwords are encrypted and saved on your peers' devices. No cyberattack with today's computing power is capable of causing problems.
- **🥷 Privacy**: No email. No passwords. Just 12 words.
- **🧩 Trust No One**: Why trust someone to convert such important data. Only you are the real owner of your data.

## 🤔 Can I create my own Hyperpass?

Of course, with the necessary skills, you can download the code and modify it as you prefer to take advantage of all the power that Hyperpass makes available.

Have fun ✨
